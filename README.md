# what is happening with our brain?    - SIVA SRINIVAS VENIGALLA

Many of us have some problems. We all see some people struggling to grasp knowledge and some feel that they aren't capable of  what they wanted to achieve.

First, I wanted you to know that there are 100 billion neurons in our brain . Despite god giving us 100 billion neurons , why people aren't using their brain in a 
a significant manner?

Actually brain is active all the time but uses significant neurons in unimportant things in life. To focuss on the work you do you should continuosly train your brain 
by doing puzzles ,mental mathematics and learning some topics and remembering it for a lot of time. You should avoid doing some silly things which affects the brain a 
lot. 
We see toppers everywhere in the world, but if you observe everyone has the same 100 billion neurons. so it definitely depend on how you train your brain and it is in 
all in your hands.
To stay focussed you should be disciplined and help your brain focussed on what you wanted to achieve .
so set small goals and be happy and have a happy life.

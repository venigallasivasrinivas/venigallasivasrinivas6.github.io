The MacBook Pro is a line of Macintosh portable computers introduced in January 2006, by Apple Inc. It is the higher-end model of the MacBook family, sitting above the consumer-focused MacBook Air, and is sold with 13- and 16-inch screens. A 17-inch version was sold from April 2006 to June 2012.

The first-generation MacBook Pro used the design of the PowerBook G4, but replaced the PowerPC G4 chips with Intel Core processors, added a webcam, and introduced the MagSafe power connector. The 15-inch model was introduced in January 2006; the 17-inch model in April. Later revisions added Core 2 Duo processors and LED-backlit displays.

The second-generation model debuted in October 2008 in 13- and 15-inch variants, with a 17-inch variant added in January 2009. Called the "unibody" model because its case was machined from a single piece of aluminum, it had a thinner flush display, a redesigned trackpad whose entire surface consisted of a single clickable button, and a redesigned keyboard. Updates brought Intel Core i5 and i7 processors and introduced Intel's Thunderbolt technology.

The third-generation MacBook Pro was released in 2012: the 15-inch in June 2012, a 13-inch model in October. It was thinner than its predecessor, made solid-state storage (SSD) standard, and included a high-resolution Retina display.

The fourth-generation MacBook Pro, released in October 2016, adopted USB-C for all data ports and power and included a shallower "butterfly"-mechanism keyboard. On all but the base model, the function keys were replaced with a touchscreen strip called the Touch Bar with a Touch ID sensor integrated into the power button.

The fifth-generation MacBook Pro, released in November 2019, returned to a scissor-mechanism keyboard. The initial 16-inch model with a screen set in narrower bezels was followed by a 13-inch model in May 2020.

In November 2020, Apple released an updated 13-inch model based on Apple silicon processors.
